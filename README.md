# Dons-Hack: WriteBoard
Do you take pictures of the whiteboard, but struggle to find the time and energy to go back through your camera roll and study them? Do you dread having to search through your notes to find which days have relevant information to a homework assignment you're trying to complete? WriteBoard can help. 

Step 1) Take pictures of the whiteboard, projector, or handwritten notes and Writeboard will scan your images for text and store your notes as text for you to study later. 

Step 2) Upload your assignments and receive references to notes with relevant information to help you work smarter and faster. 

Now you can relax in class and listen to the lecture rather than scrambling to write everything from the board before it's erased forever!
